# Unix_Shell_Emulator_From_Scratch
A unix shell emulator written in C that allows running commands and supports piping as well as file input/output redirection.
 
Was written from scratch (including the comlpex parsing needed) with no guidance, unlike the Unix_Shell_Emulator repo, that supports more functionalities but was written using given steps and came with an implemented parser.
